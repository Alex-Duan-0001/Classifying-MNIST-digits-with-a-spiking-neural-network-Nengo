# Classifying-MNIST-digits-with-a-spiking-neural-network-Nengo
This repo mainly focus on how to build a spiking neural network to classfy the digits from 0-9 on MNIST dataset on Nengo platform. The code and related explanation will be stated and the idea is mainly from the literature (Training Spiking Deep Networks for Neuromorphic Hardware) and examples on Nengo website (Optimizing a spiking neural network). The wish is to instruct the reader can fully understand the code and knowledge behind in a very simple way.
